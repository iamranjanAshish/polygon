<h1>Polygon Tool</h1>
<b>This tool is used to create any n-sided regular polygon</b> <br>
Some of the samples are given below <br>
<b>7-sided Regular Polygon</b>

<b>43-sided Regular Polygon</b>

You might not see the polygon, <br> 
Well, that's because a 43-sided polygon <b>seems</b> to overlap a circle when viewed from a macro scale, <br>
But when you zoom in, the edges become obvious, as you may see on the right.<br>
<b>So, going by this logic, as the the number of sides approaches infinity, the polygon 'becomes' the circle</b> <br>
<b>which in turn implies, that a 'Circle is nothing but a polygon of Infinite Sides'.</b> Right? <br>
<br>
